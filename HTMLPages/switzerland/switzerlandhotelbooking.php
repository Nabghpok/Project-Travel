                <p>
                The historical Hotel Schweizerhof is located opposite Zurich main station
                 and is the ideal starting point for visiting the city by the banks of river 
                 Limmat. The famous pedestrian shopping street "Bahnhofstrasse" with its exclusive
                  shops are just a stone's throw away from the hotel’s doorstep. Zurich's up-and-coming 
                  neighbourhood "Europaallee", the classic financial district by "Paradeplatz" 
                  and Zurich’s sightseeing spots are all within steps of the hotel.
