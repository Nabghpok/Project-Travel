                    Egypt, country located in the northeastern corner of Africa. Egypt’s heartland, the Nile River valley
                     and delta, was the home of one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East and, like
                      Mesopotamia farther east, was the site of one of the world’s earliest urban and literate societies.

                    Pharaonic Egypt thrived for some 3,000 years through a series of native dynasties that 
                    were interspersed with brief periods of foreign rule. After Alexander the Great conquered
                     the region in 323 BCE, urban Egypt became an integral part of the Hellenistic world. 
                     Under the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, an advanced literate society thrived in the city of 
                     Alexandria, but what is now Egypt was conquered by the Romans in 30 BCE. It remained part
                      of the Roman Republic and Empire and then part of Rome’s successor state, the Byzantine
                       Empire, until its conquest by Arab Muslim armies in 639–642 CE.

                    Egypt eventually became one of the intellectual and cultural centres of the Arab and Islamic 
                    world, a status that was fortified in the mid-13th century when Mongol armies sacked Baghdad 
                    and ended the Abbasid caliphate. The Mamluk sultans of Egypt, under whom the country thrived 
                    for several centuries, established a pseudo-caliphate of dubious legitimacy. But in 1517 the 
                    Ottoman Empire defeated the Mamluks and established control over Egypt that lasted until 1798,
                     when Napoleon I led a French army in a short occupation of the country.

                    Apart from the Nile, the only natural perennial surface drainage consists of a few small
                     streams in the mountains of the southern Sinai Peninsula. Most of the valleys of the 
                     Eastern Desert drain westward to the Nile. They are eroded by water but normally dry; 
                     only after heavy rainstorms in the Red Sea Hills do they carry torrents. The shorter 
                     valleys on the eastern flank of the Red Sea Hills drain toward the Red Sea; they, too, 
                     are normally dry. Drainage in the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula is toward the gulfs 
                     of Suez and Aqaba; as in the Red Sea Hills, torrent action has produced valleys that 
                     are deeply eroded and normally dry.

                    Egypt lies within the North African desert belt; its general climatic characteristics,
                     therefore, are low annual precipitation and a considerable seasonal and diurnal (daily) 
                     temperature range, with sunshine occurring throughout the year. In the desert, cyclones
                      stir up sandstorms or dust storms, called khamsins (Arabic: “fifties,” as they are said
                       to come 50 days per year), which occur most frequently from March to June;
                       these are caused by tropical air from the south that moves northward as a result of the 
                       extension northeastward of the low-pressure system of Sudan. A khamsin is accompanied by 
                       a sharp increase in temperature of 14 to 20 °F (8 to 11 °C), a drop in relative humidity 
                       (often to 10 percent), and thick dust; winds can reach gale force.
