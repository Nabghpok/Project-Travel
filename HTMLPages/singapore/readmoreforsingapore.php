                    Singapore is a multi-ethnic state, and this affects the linguistic diversity. 
                    The official languages are English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil. The official language
                     of Singapore, in which most business communication and documentation is conducted, 
                     is English. This is due to historical reasons, as Singapore was a British colony and
                      retains close ties with English-speaking countries.In everyday communication,
                       Singaporeans often use "Singapore English", also known as "Singlish". 
                       It is a distinct dialect of English that has been influenced by local cultures and 
                       traditions. Despite its specificity, Singlish is quite understandable for most
                        English-speaking people.
